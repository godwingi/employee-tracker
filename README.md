## Installation
  Please make sure that you install the following packages: console.table, inquirer, and mysql2. In addition, prior to running the code, you will need to input your own password in the index.js file, as I removed mine when uploading my code to github.

## Usage
  Once your installations are complete, please type "npm start" to start the application. You will then come across the "Task Manager" which will prompt you to choose an action. Once you choose an action, it will either show you your existing information or give you prompts to add or change to the exisiting information.
